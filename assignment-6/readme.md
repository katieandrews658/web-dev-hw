<h2>Design Process & Font Choice</h2>
  <p>I chose the fonts sarif and sans-serif because they are easy to read. I also had Verdana as a back up because it seemed like a slightly more fantasy font, but was still easy to read. There was a lot of text because it is Harry Potter, so it has to be easy to read.</p>
<h2>System Font, Web Font, & Web-Safe Font</h2>
  <p>A system font is one that is already installed on the device.</p>
  <p>A web font is a custom font that is hosted on a server.</p>
  <p>A web-safe font is a font that both Windows and Mac should have on their computers</p>
  <p>It is important to have fallback fonts or a font stack so that if the web browser can't load your preferred font, the text can still be pulled up. </p>
