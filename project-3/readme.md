<h2>Difference Between Padding, Margin, and Borders</h2>
  <p>Padding is the amount of space between the inner content of the element and the element itself</p>
  <p>Margin is the space between the box/element and other elements</p>
  <p>Borders are an area around the element that can be separetly colored and has multiple style options. It is a visual styling tool rather than a style management tool</p>
<h2>Hardest Task for Me</h2>
  <p>For me the hardest problem was the overlapping elements. It was hard for me to get the picture large enough to cover the whole screen and then for the other elements to pop back up. It took me a while and a lot of trial and error to finally figure it out. </p>
