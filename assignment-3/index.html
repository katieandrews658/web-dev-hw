      <h1> Basic Crepes </h1>
      <quote> Crepes are arguably one of the best breakfast foods because they can be <b> sweet and savory </b> This is why they are one of the <u> recipes you should use everyday. </u> </quote>
      <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> <b>1 cup</b> all-purpose flour</li>
            <li><b>2</b> eggs</li>
            <li><b>1/2 cup</b> milk</li>
            <li><b>1/2 cup</b> water</li>
            <li><b>1/4 teaspoon</b> salt</li>
            <li><b>2 tablespoons</b> butter, melted</li>
              <!--Check up on this bolding of the amounts. May look weird aesthetically-->
        </ul>
      <h2> Directions </h2>
        <ol>
          <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
          <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
          <li>Cook the crepe for about <em>2 minutes</em>, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
