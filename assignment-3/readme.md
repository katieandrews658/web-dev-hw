  <h2>Question B> </h2>
    <p> There can only be 1 <b> main </b> "<head>" and 1 <b> main </b> "<body>" element in a page. These two different elements are different because the "<head>" element is used to process the information, while the "<body>" element is where all of the main information goes that is displayed on the person's computer. </p>

  <h2>Question C</h2>
    <p> The main difference between structural and semantic markup is that while structural is discussing the parts of the markup which is what is there, the semantic is what describes how it should look. Semantic markup is more about the aesthetic of the page, while structural is about what is on the page, information wise. </p>

  <h2> Work Cycle, Question D </h2>
    <p>This cycle, I was a little confused for about 15 minutes as to what the assignment would be about. I solved this problem by reading the assignment over and over again, but next time I would appreciate it if the fact that we needed a recipe off the internet was stated more clearly </p>
    <p>I would be interested in discussing the internal and external hyperlinks further. They were interesting and while I will do my own research on them, it was hard to grasp the whole topic. If we could go more in depth on that topic or at least approached it from a different way, I could easily understand it. It seems like a vital part of web design. </p>
    <p> I would like to say that I like how easy it is to read hypertext once you understand the abbreviations. It makes everything so clean and simple. I appreciate that on an aesthetic sense. </p>
