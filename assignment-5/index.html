      <h1>Color Trends in the 80's</h1>

        <p id="neon-description" class="card-description">
          In the eighties, neon was everywhere. The words "hot" and "electric" are two great words to describe this decade's fascination with neon. Every color has it's own neon version of it and it was everywhere. Neon was on everything, sunglasses, jewelry, shirts, etc.

          This color trend is more subdued than the more popular neon trend. It was usually very spring colors that wwere worn everywhere, specifically among the "preppy" crowd. These colors are pink, blue, yellow, and green. These colors are still popular to this day.

        <h2 class="card-label">Combination of Colors</h2>
        <p id="combination-description" class="card-description">
          Many times the two above trends were paired with the black and white trend. There were many bold colors, like zebra print, that were combined with neon or pastels, or even substitued the neon for black and white. This also transfered out of fashion choice and into interior design. This has continued into today.
