<h2> Design Research</h2>
  <p>I chose the 70's and I chose the wavy rainbow for this assignment. I styled my web page in reflection of the seventies because I wanted the rainbow to stand out. The blue in the rainbow was the most hidden and understated, so I chose that as the background. I then went on to change the colors of the text so that it resembled a rainbow</p>

<h2>Color Palette</h2>
  <p>I tried to make my page resemble the rainbow as much as possible, which is reflected in my color palette</p>
  <p>I used these colors:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Background Color:rgb(11,43,255)</li>
      <li>Background Color for text container: white</li>
      <li>H1 color: rgb(212,0,0)</li>
      <li>Paragraph 1: rgb(255,245,3)</li>
      <li>Paragraph 2:rgb(2,214,0)</li>
      <li>Paragraph 3: rgb(162,0,163)</li>
    </ol>
