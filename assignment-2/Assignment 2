  <li> Briefly describe one way how data travels on the internet.
    <ul>
      <ui> One way that data travels in the internet is through routers. Routers are similar to traffic managers which can help the different IP packets travel through the networks easily. They direct the packets to different routes so no data gets congested. It helps the internet be reliable.

  <li>What is the relationship between an IP address and the DNS?
    <ul>
      <ui> IP address means internet protocol address. This is a number which lets the different internet providers know where the IP address came from and where it is going, much like actual addresses. A DNS is the Domain Name System, it is the .com parts of the web address. While the IP address is just numbers, the DNS is actual words. The computer uses the DNS to look up domain names and get the associated IP address so they can receive the proper data for the computer.
