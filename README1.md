# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Katie Andrews

I decided to take this class because my mother is a web designer and I want to know what it is she does everyday. I also believe that this is a necessary skill that people need to have now a days. The internet is something that people use everyday. Knowing what the internet is, how it works, and how to create websites is an essential skill that is applicable in every major and career.

- The internet was originally a defense department funded experiment.
- There is a difference between the internet and the World Wide Web.
- Internet is shared around the world with cords laid out all along the ocean floor.
