<h2>Nriefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans</h2>
  <p>IDs are unique to each specific element. Classes allow a person to group elements together if they are similar. Divs group elements together as well but hey group together block-level elements and can be singular or nested. Spans is the inline equivalent of the div element. It identifies content that needs extra styling/organization.</p>

<h2> What is "alt text," and why do we use it? </h2>
  <p>Alt text provides a test description of the image which describes the image if you can't see it. </p>
  <p>We use alt text because the search engines rely on the descriptions used to find hte images. It also helps the images show up in the results of image-based searches. </p>
